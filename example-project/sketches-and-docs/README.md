You could place images, videos, writings, support documents, etc., here. 
Tip: if you've uploaded an image to your repo, you can display it in any README by just using its filename, like so: 

`![alt text](image.png)`

OR using HTML, which allows you to customize the size:

`<img width=300 src="image.png"></img>`


![bunnies](easter.png)
<img width=300, src="easter.png"></img>
