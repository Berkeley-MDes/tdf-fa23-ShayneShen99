### Reflections

ðŸ”´ I've been mainly working on photon and OLED screens this week. Theoretically, this is a quite simple task, but for some reason, all of our photon Adafruit libraries acted up.

ðŸ”´ Our references

ðŸ”´ [Adafruit official coding + wiring instruction](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/wiring-128x64-oleds)

ðŸ”´ [Photon 2 datasheet](https://docs.particle.io/reference/datasheets/wi-fi/photon-2-datasheet/)

### Speculations

ðŸŸ¡ Our Monday's guest speaker's visualization of voice looks cool, although I didn't understand most of the technical aspects he mentioned. It provides an easier space for musicians and sound engineers to fine-tune vocal performances, adjust pitch, and create unique soundscapes. It reminds me of many open. processing projects that convert pop music to artsy visual patterns, which can be a game-changer for people with hearing impairments. 

ðŸŸ¡ Our team's concept of an emotional vending machine would be incredibly enjoyable if it could be transformed into a functioning vending machine and put into operation. I can imagine it implementing an AI assistant. 

### Summary

ðŸ”µ We got our hands dirty this week haha!
