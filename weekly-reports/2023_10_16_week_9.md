### Reflections

ðŸ”´ I've been mainly working on photon and OLED screens this week. Theoretically, this should be a quite simple task, even easier than the LED. But for some reason, all of our photon Adafruit libraries acted up.

ðŸ”´ Helpful references I found online

1. [Adafruit official coding + wiring instruction](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/wiring-128x64-oleds)

2. [Photon 2 datasheet](https://docs.particle.io/reference/datasheets/wi-fi/photon-2-datasheet/)

3. [OLED + Photon showcase](https://medium.com/home-wireless/adding-a-tiny-oled-display-to-the-particle-photon-fe95cf36860d)

4. [Github used in #3](https://github.com/pkourany/Adafruit_SSD1306/blob/master/ssd1306_128x64_i2c.ino)

ðŸ”´ Debug process

The main issue I encountered is the "redefinition of â€˜class Adafruit_SSD1306'" or "redefinition of â€˜class Adafruit_GFX'". For some reason, these libraries couldn't load properly. Something might be wrong with the web.IDE since it's a basic website for starters to run the blink project. After meeting with Jeff, I switched to the Visual Studio and finally got the OLED working! 

ðŸ”´ Issues 

Every step was wrongâ€“â€“I was quite frustrated but learned so much from the process.

1. Soldering was so bad and I had to ask help from Gary. His soldering skill is impeccable.
2. The wiring was wrongâ€“â€“I switched it to I2C mode later.
3. I forgot to import the Adafruit libraries.
4. I probably imported these libraries multiple times, and that's why the "redefining" error kept popping up.
5. 

### Speculations

ðŸŸ¡ Our Monday's guest speaker's visualization of voice looks cool, although I didn't understand most of the technical aspects he mentioned. It provides an easier space for musicians and sound engineers to fine-tune vocal performances, adjust pitch, and create unique soundscapes. It reminds me of many open. processing projects that convert pop music to artsy visual patterns, which can be a game-changer for people with hearing impairments. 

ðŸŸ¡ Our team's concept of an emotional vending machine would be incredibly enjoyable if it could be transformed into a functioning vending machine and put into operation. I can imagine it implementing an AI assistant. 

### Summary

ðŸ”µ We got our hands dirty this week haha!
