### 🔴🔴🔴 Reflections

This is a one-week project, so let's do something fast and funky!🎃 The first time I used ChatGPT, I asked it to give a Shakespeare-style self-introduction. I read a book about ecogenetics and robots last week, and I got this out-there idea––Let's design a chatbot who sounds like Shakespeare living in the age of cyberpunk!

### 🟡🟡🟡 Speculations

Our guest speaker's presentation was genuinely inspiring. Her innovation in creating solar sites is truly remarkable. The concept of utilizing the versatility of polyester and converting it into a foldable, lightweight support structure for solar panels is undeniably ingenious. I'm also impressed by the clarity and aesthetic appeal of her presentation. Even from the far end of the classroom, I could clearly see every word and detail.

I want to express my gratitude for inviting her to our class. The engineering field greatly benefits from the presence of more female voices and role models.

### 🔵🔵🔵 Summary

This week has been a lot of fun. PB's demo was truly inspiring.
