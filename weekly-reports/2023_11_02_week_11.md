### 🔴🔴🔴 Reflections

This is a one-week project, so let's do something fast and funky!🎃 The first time I used ChatGPT, I asked it to give a Shakespeare-style self-introduction. I read a book about ecogenetics and robots last week, and I got this out-there idea––Let's design a chatbot who sounds like Shakespeare living in the age of cyberpunk!

### 🟡🟡🟡 Speculations

Our guest speaker's talk was truly inspiring. Her innovation of solar energy-assisted machines is amazing. The idea of leveraging the flexibility of polyester and transforming that material into foldable and lightweight support for panels is quite genius. I also appreciate her presentation's clarity and beautiful design. Scale-wise, I can see every word and single detail from the other end of the classroom.

### 🔵🔵🔵 Summary

This week has been a lot of fun. PB's demo was truly inspiring.
