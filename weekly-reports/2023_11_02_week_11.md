Training a LLM was fun. 

### ğŸŸ¡ğŸŸ¡ğŸŸ¡ Speculations

Our guest speaker's presentation was inspiring. Her innovation in creating solar sites is remarkable! The concept of utilizing the versatility of polyester and converting it into a foldable, lightweight support structure for solar panels is ingenious. I'm also impressed by the clarity of her presentation. Even from the far end of the classroom, I could see every word and detail. I also want to say thank you for inviting her to our class. The engineering field will certainly benefit from the presence of more female voices and role models.
