### ğŸ”´ğŸ”´ğŸ”´ Reflections

Training a LLM was fun. 

ğŸ”´ My AI assumed that I was male. Notice the pronouns it used?

ğŸ”´ I had to clarify my pronouns and personal identity in the knowledge set. This also made me realize that AI is not supposed to know everything â€“â€“ it only takes the information you put in.

ğŸ”´ Another challenge I encountered was when I accidentally connected the greeting message to the knowledge set.

### ğŸŸ¡ğŸŸ¡ğŸŸ¡ Speculations

Our guest speaker's presentation was inspiring. Her innovation in creating solar sites is remarkable! The concept of utilizing the versatility of polyester and converting it into a foldable, lightweight support structure for solar panels is ingenious. I'm also impressed by the clarity of her presentation. Even from the far end of the classroom, I could see every word and detail. I also want to say thank you for inviting her to our class. The engineering field will certainly benefit from the presence of more female voices and role models.
