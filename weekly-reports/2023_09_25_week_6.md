## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### Reflections

ðŸ”´ I had a lot of fun during the group project. 
My top three picks are: 
ðŸ”´ Exploring Mental Health Needs of Graduate Students: Building Physical Sensors for Anxiety Tracking and Study Habits Analysis; 
ðŸ”´ Empowering Communities: Building a Small Carbon Trading Center and Platform for Individuals; 
ðŸ”´ Smart Pill Reminder: Enhancing Medication Adherence with Sensor-based Technology.

### Speculations

ðŸŸ¡ Adrian Freed gave an awesome speech on Monday. His thoughts on interface design and our group practices on Dango had an interesting coincidence. The relevance between material/conductor choice and his conductive finger-phone was quite inspiring. I had no idea we could flatten electronics and the soldering process and exhibit them on a piece of paper. I wonder about the possibility of transforming any instrument, for instance, a violin, into a sheet of paper. This would significantly assist sustainable practices.  

ðŸŸ¡ I found a similar project, FabricKeyboard, in the MIT media lab. MIT researchers have developed a unique musical instrument crafted from soft layers of fabric interwoven with sensors using conductive thread. This experimental keyboard offers both traditional playability and responds to pressure, proximity, and stretching. While currently limited to a few keys, the researchers plan to expand its range and add more sounds. This innovation continues the lineage of musically intelligent textiles developed by MIT, including a fabric-sensor ball for music creation through squeezing and stretching, as well as a conductor's jacket equipped with sensors to capture gestures, heart rate, and body temperature.
