### Speculations

ðŸŸ¡ 
ðŸŸ¡ Adrian Freed gave an awesome speech on Monday. His thoughts on interface design and our group practices on Dango had an interesting coincidence. The relevance between material/conductor choice and his conductive finger-phone was quite inspiring. I had no idea we could flatten electronics and the soldering process and exhibit them on a piece of paper. I wonder about the possibility of transforming any instrument, for instance, a violin, into a sheet of paper. This would significantly assist sustainable practices.
