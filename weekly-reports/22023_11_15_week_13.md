## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ Reflections
During Monday's guest lecture, I learned about a new emerging technology, O.SE. I've only had a brief experience with TouchOSC before, incorporating a bit of "dynamic behavior" into my static poster and installation designs. John explained OSC so clearly and thoroughly that I finally understood this protocol. O.SE, the more advanced and generalized version of OSC, is a much more flexible and easy-to-implement protocol for real-time communication. It simplifies the control of parameters in multimedia applications, making it useful and meaningful for building interactivity and creativity. I also find both decks exceptionally clear and well-designed, inspiring me in terms of presentation format and visualization. 

During the poster session, I encountered plenty of intriguing ideas and decided to team up with Abigail and Eliza. Abi's idea revolves around the intersection of GPT and new media art, providing me with a fair chance to apply my understanding of Midjourney. 

### ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ Speculations
The interaction between AI entities, even when shaped by human training, still retains a distinct machine quality. I believe this project offers insights into the essence of artificial intelligence, exploring the nuances of communication and unlocking the potential for creativity within machine interactions. 

### ðŸ”µðŸ”µðŸ”µ Summary
Monday's lecture introduced O.SE, an advanced version of TouchOSC, simplifies real-time communication. The speaker praised John's clear explanation of OSC and found O.SE flexible for multimedia applications. 

The AI pin was recently released, offering a compact and stylish way to showcase your interest in artificial intelligence. Featuring a sleek design, it's the perfect accessory for tech enthusiasts and AI aficionados alike. I perceive it as a fresh iteration of the iWatch, incorporating a clip. The real test will be gauging people's reactions to it.
