### ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ Reflections
During Monday's guest lecture, I learned about new technologies, O.SE and ODot. I've only had a brief experience with TouchOSC before, incorporating a bit of "dynamic behavior" into my static poster and installation designs. John explained OSC in such a clear and thorough way that I finally understood this protocol. O.SE, the more advanced and generalized version of OSC, seems like a much more flexible and easy-to-implement protocol for real-time communication. It simplifies the control of parameters in multimedia applications, making it useful and meaningful for building interactivity and creativity. I also think both decks are super clear and well-designed.
