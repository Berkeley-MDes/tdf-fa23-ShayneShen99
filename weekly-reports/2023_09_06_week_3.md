# ðŸ¤” Week of 09/06/23 (Week 3)
## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### Reflections
ðŸŸ  This week, I delved deeper into parametric design by immersing myself in a few Grasshopper tutorials and putting that knowledge into practice. Building on what I learned last week, I now have a more profound understanding of the software's inner workings.

ðŸŸ  It's truly interesting how seamlessly Grasshopper integrates with Rhino, allowing for fast and precise generative modeling. Even starting with a simple geometry, like a sphere as shown belowðŸ‘‡, can lead to the creation of fascinating iterative visuals. As a graphic designer, I wonder if Grasshopper can be applied to other scenarios.

### Speculations
ðŸŸ¡ After my experimentation with Grasshopper, I circled back to our cellphone stand project. My aim is to design a stand that securely holds my phone in a vertical position, at an angle that ensures a clear and comfortable view of the screen. I began with a fundamental yet essential form - rectangles (or cuboids? I don't know why Rhino keeps calling it a 2-point rectangle.).

ðŸŸ¡ I envision this rectangle being inclined towards the ground, with horizontal feet attached to its lower end. However, I'm still trying to figure out the rest of it...

ðŸŸ¡ It's interesting to note that, although not directly related to this course, I came across an intriguing TikTok account. This account features videos of a chef crafting cakes with the precision and creativity of an architect working on their final project models. The chef himself oftenly uses a cutting mat, Xeto knife, etc.
