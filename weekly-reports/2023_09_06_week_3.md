# ğŸ¤” Week of 09/06/23 (Week 3)
## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### Reflections
ğŸ”´ I dived deeper into parametric design this week: I watched a couple of Grasshopper tutorials and practiced with them. With the experience from last week, I was able to understand the inner logic of this software. 
ğŸ”´ It's amazing how Grasshopper connects with Rhino and produces generative modeling agilely.
