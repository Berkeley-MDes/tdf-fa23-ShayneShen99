### Reflections

ðŸ”´ This is a one-week project, so let's do something fast and funky!ðŸŽƒ The first time I used ChatGPT, I asked it to give a Shakespeare-style self-introduction. I read a book about ecogenetics and robots last week, and I got this out-there ideaâ€“â€“Let's design a chatbot who sounds like Shakespeare living in the age of cyberpunk!ðŸ’ƒ

Steps

1. Add a new instruction, name it, and type in my prompt.

2. Ask Chatgpt 3.5 to generate a greeting

3. Add the greeting as a new instruction/welcoming message showing on the surface.

### Speculations

ðŸŸ¡ My teammate and I are working on a project to streamline the user experience of prompt-generating on Midjourney. Based on our research and personal experience, it's challenging for beginners with the language barrier to generate appropriate prompts. 

ðŸŸ¡ We were considering launching LLM-assisted features like word prediction. We never think the features can be actualized within our capability, but with Zerowidth, we might be able to prototype a small, entry-level foundational language model.  

ðŸŸ¡ The *vector embedding tool seems very powerful in terms of building a connection with the right prompt and the right image. To achieve this goal, it requires intensive training in object recognition. 

### Summary

P.S. I don't use ChatGPT for writing anymore. Forgive me if I sound like an eight-year-old.
