### Speculations

ðŸŸ¡ My teammate and I are working on a project to streamline the user experience of prompt-generating on Midjourney. Based on our research and personal experience, it's challenging for beginners with the language barrier to generate appropriate prompts. 

ðŸŸ¡ We were considering launching LLM-assisted features like word prediction. We never think the features can be actualized within our capability, but with Zerowidth, we might be able to prototype a small, entry-level foundational language model.
