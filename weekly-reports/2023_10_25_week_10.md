# ðŸ¤” Week of 10/25/23 (Week 10)
## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### Reflections

ðŸ”´ This is a one-week project, so let's do something fast and funky!ðŸŽƒ The first time I used ChatGPT, I asked it to give a Shakespeare-style self-introduction. I read a book about ecogenetics and robots last week, and I got this out-there ideaâ€“â€“Let's design a chatbot who sounds like Shakespeare living in the age of cyberpunk!ðŸ’ƒ

Steps

1. Add a new instruction, name it, and type in my prompt.

2. Ask Chatgpt 3.5 to generate a greeting

3. Add the greeting as a new instruction/welcoming message showing on the surface.

4. Feed the cyberpunk glossary to add some spice!

5. Oops! There were 11624 tokensâ€“â€“and the server broke down. I chose a shorter glossary and now there're only 701 tokens.

### Demo

### Challenge

When giving a normal command, the bot forgets about its identity.

I need to update the first instruction.

### Speculations

ðŸŸ¡ My teammate and I are working on a project to streamline the user experience of prompt-generating on Midjourney. Based on our research and personal experience, it's challenging for beginners with the language barrier to generate appropriate prompts. 

ðŸŸ¡ We were considering launching LLM-assisted features like word prediction. We never think the features can be actualized within our capability, but with Zerowidth, we might be able to prototype a small, entry-level foundational language model. The *vector embedding tool seems very powerful in terms of building a connection with the right prompt and the right image. To achieve this goal, it requires intensive training in object recognition. We'll work on this project in the future and let you know the final outcome.

### Summary

ðŸ”µ This week has been a lot of fun. PB's demo was truly inspiring.
