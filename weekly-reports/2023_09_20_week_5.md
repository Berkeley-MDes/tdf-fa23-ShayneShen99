# ðŸ˜„ Week of 09/21/23 (Week 5)
## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### Reflections

ðŸ”´ I couldn't attend our Monday class due to my illness. However, as I watched the lecture from home, I was filled with excitement as we embarked on our journey into the intriguing realm of digital fabrication. I also worked with Photon 2. This proved to be quite challenging, primarily because its activation procedure demanded a deeper understanding of coding compared to Arduino. I found Photon extremely difficult to work with on campus so I ran home and everything suddenly worked out.
ðŸ”´ I believe that Photon has the potential to outperform Arduino in upcoming scenarios due to its wireless capabilities. 

### Speculations

ðŸŸ¡ I attended the Career Conversation with Jenna Fizel, the Senior Director of Emerging Technology at IDEO. One of the highlights of Jenna's talk was the case studies of their past projects that demonstrated how digital data can be creatively and compellingly transformed into immersive physical experiences. Their ability to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds was truly remarkable. The real-world examples she shared were not only visually captivating but also showcased the potential for technology to create meaningful and engaging experiences in our daily lives. 


### Summary
ðŸ”µ I honestly don't feel well this week and I apologize for the short weekly reflection. I'll work on it later.
