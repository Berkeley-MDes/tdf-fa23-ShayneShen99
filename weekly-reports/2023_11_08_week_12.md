### ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ Reflections

This week has brought numerous significant developments in the AI industry. Our guest speaker reminded me to watch the GPT 4.0 launch event, as it promises multiple groundbreaking features for creators and UX designers like myself. The latest addition, GPT Store, reminded me of our previous project with ZeroWidth. Once ChatGPT enters the creator sphere, it will undoubtedly disrupt the ecosystem, much like what Midjourney and DALLÂ·E did for illustration artists. As someone deeply interested in AI drawing tools and future AI applications, I genuinely appreciate this class's consistent ability to inspire me and provide the latest news in the world-leading tech industry. I would also like to thank our professors for inviting guest speakers.

### ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¡ Speculations
In my UX design class, the professor asked us why ChatGPT reached 100 million users in 2 months. ChatGPT was launched following the success of Midjourney and DALLÂ·E, and it had extensive media coverage. The product itself is minimal, user-friendly, and remarkably efficient, and, crucially, it's available for free. Its capabilities, exceeding searching engineers, encouraged users to switch to subscription mode. How Chat GPT implements itself into DALLÂ·E prompt generation inspired me. My teammates and I are currently developing features to enhance Midjourney's prompt generation. In addition, Twitter, or X, has recently introduced Grok, its chatbot. AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in the tech industry, and as UX designers, we must find ways to optimize human-AI interactions.
