# ðŸ¤” Week of 09/12/23 (Week 4)
## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### Reflections
ðŸŸ  This week, I delved deeper into parametric design by immersing myself in a few Grasshopper tutorials and putting that knowledge into practice. Building on what I learned last week, I now have a more profound understanding of the software's inner workings.

ðŸŸ  It's exciting how seamlessly Grasshopper integrates with Rhino, allowing for fast and precise generative modeling. Even starting with a simple geometry, like a sphere as shown belowðŸ‘‡, can lead to the creation of fascinating iterative visuals. As a graphic designer, I wonder if Grasshopper can be applied to other scenarios.

### Speculations
ðŸŸ¡ After my experimentation with Grasshopper, I circled back to our cellphone stand project. My aim is to design a stand that securely holds my phone in a vertical position, at an angle that ensures a clear and comfortable view of the screen. I began with a fundamental yet essential form - rectangles (or cuboids? I don't know why Rhino keeps calling it a 2-point rectangle.).

### Summary
ðŸ”µ Many renowned pastry chefs, such as Amaury Guichon, often incorporate engineering techniques and knowledge into their art pieces, resulting in impeccable creations. The level of meticulousness, dexterity, and precision they exhibit can be magical. Learning engineering skills in this class mirrors that experience for me. While I may not pursue a career as an industrial designer, the knowledge and skills I've gained will undoubtedly shape and elevate my perspective.
