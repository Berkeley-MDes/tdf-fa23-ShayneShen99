### Reflections
üü† Prepare for a lot of pictures. Make sure you're on wifi üíªÔºÅ

I started from what I left over last week.

The taller rectangle is precisely the same size as my iPhone, while the lower rectangle serves as a cellphone stand. It resembles almost half of an AirPod case, but it lacks the capacity to support a smartphone. A smartphone has significantly higher mass and weight in comparison to an AirPod.

### Design Ver.1

### Oops! 
I could not export the Rhino file as STL for 3D printing.

I kept trying for a while until I had a realization: BAKE your model! How can one select a geometric shape when, in fact, it's a set of instructions within Grasshopper?

## Problem occurred during 3D Printing

### Ultimaker Cura

I started with using Ultimaker S3 on the second floor. It failed the first time...and the second time.

### Prusa

I failed the first time, but I made it the second time!

It was my first experience with 3D printing, and it took some time for me to properly configure everything and prepare the model for slicing.

Tada!!! I‚Äòm excited about the final result.
