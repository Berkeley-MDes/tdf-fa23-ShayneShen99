# üëº Week of 09/12/23 (Week 4)
## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### Reflections
üü† Prepare for a lot of pictures. Make sure you're on wifi üíªÔºÅ

I started from what I left over last week.

The taller rectangle is precisely the same size as my iPhone, while the lower rectangle serves as a cellphone stand. It resembles almost half of an AirPod case, but it lacks the capacity to support a smartphone. A smartphone has significantly higher mass and weight in comparison to an AirPod.

### Design Ver.1

### Oops! 
I could not export the Rhino file as STL for 3D printing.

I kept trying for a while until I had a realization: Baking your model! How can one select a geometric shape when, in fact, it's a set of instructions within Grasshopper?

## Problem occurred during 3D Printing

### Ultimaker Cura

I started with using Ultimaker S3 on the second floor. It failed the first time...and the second time.

### Prusa

I failed the first time, but I made it the second time!

It took me a while to set everything properly and slice the model.
