The taller rectangle is the exact same size as my iPhone, and the lower rectangle is supposed to be a cellphone stand. It feels almost like half of an Airpod case, but it wouldn't be able to carry a smartphone, the mass point and weight of which are both a lot higher than an Airpod. 

### Design Ver.1

### Oops! 
I could not export the Rhino file as STL for 3D printing.
