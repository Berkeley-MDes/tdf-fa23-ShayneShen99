# ðŸ˜„ Week of 10/03/23 (Week 7)
## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### Reflections

ðŸ”´ Monday's lecture was truly inspiring. One of the mechanisms in TJ's animal vending machine, where dropping a token triggers LED color changes, served as a perfect illustration of how we can apply our kit.

ðŸ”´ Although I didn't fully grasp the technical aspects of Jeff's lecture on gesture recognition, I found some of the software he mentioned intriguing, especially Edge Impulse and Max MSP.

ðŸ”´ I'm already familiar with Open Processing, and it's a fantastic open-source platform. It has been the most relatable part of TDF for me so far, given my interest in visual design.

### Speculations

ðŸŸ¡ TJ's utilization of an Excel form to allocate students to various groups was not only efficient but also visually appealing. I'm interested in the algorithm that underlies this grouping process.

### Summary
ðŸ”µ It's been a hectic week!
