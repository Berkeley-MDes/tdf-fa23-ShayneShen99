## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

### Reflections
🔴 I learned the concept of computational design, an iterative approach to design that utilizes computer algorithms, data, and automation to generate and optimize creative solutions. I also learned about GitHub Markdown, entry-level Rhino, and using Grasshopper to adjust parameters. The demos and examples provided by instructors have been extremely helpful.

🔴 I adjusted the parameters of the cellphone stand in Grasshopper. Although the interface is a bit challenging to get started with, I found the procedural language to be quite similar to many software programs I've used or seen before, such as TouchDesigner and Unity.

🔴 I also completed general safety training and used the laser cutter in the Maker Space to cut a 1/4-inch wood board. I subtly modified the original design, adding more cutouts to reduce the overall weight of the cellphone stand.

🔴 The measurements were a bit off, which resulted in the assembly being wobbly. To stabilize it, I used tape at the bottom of the board to keep everything together.

### Speculations
> Technology is a word that describes something that doesn’t work yet. — Douglas Adams

I love this quote because it accurately describes the current state of my MDes life and this project, that the unknown contains infinite possibilities. I will take some time to develop a user scenario for the cellphone stand-up. Maybe it can be a vertical holder for reading recipes while I'm cooking at home. Or it can be both a holder and a sound amplifier. I plan to incorporate 3D printing into the future fabrication process.

Throughout the process, I can envision several points where AI can assist me. For instance, AI can efficiently retrieve the numerical specifications of our smartphones from a reliable database, saving us time compared to manual measurement or online searches. A well-trained AI, just like Dall-E-2, can generate models that align with our requirements based on our written (or verbal) descriptions.
