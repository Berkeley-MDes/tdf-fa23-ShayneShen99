## Reflections
This week I Learned the concept of computational design, which is an iterative approach to design that utilizes computer algorithms, data, and automation to generate and optimize creative solutions. I also learned about GitHub markdown, entry-level Rhino, and using Grasshopper to adjust parameters. The demo and example provided by instructors have been utterly helpful. I also finished general safety training and used the laser cutter in Maker Space to cut a 1/4-inch wood board. 

I worked on 

## Speculations
> Technology is a word that describes something that doesnâ€™t work yet.
## Summary:


please include images of attempts to tweak file, & images of laser cut objects (if you are successful)
reflect on the experience of exploring a procedural model whose output is a cell phone stand design in Rhino
Consider: What other contextual observations would be useful to capture?
Consider: What other evaluations of results would be useful to provide as feedback?
Consider: Are there points in the process where you think AIâ€¦
Could be used to assist?
Could be trained on input and output?
Other?
