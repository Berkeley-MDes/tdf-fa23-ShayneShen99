# ðŸ˜„ Week of 08/28/23 (Week 2)
## Shayne Shen, Technology Design Foundation

## Reflections
ðŸ”´ I learned the concept of computational design, an iterative approach to design that utilizes computer algorithms, data, and automation to generate and optimize creative solutions. I also learned about GitHub Markdown, entry-level Rhino, and using Grasshopper to adjust parameters. The demos and examples provided by instructors have been extremely helpful.

ðŸ”´ I adjusted the parameters of the cellphone stand in Grasshopper. Although the interface is a bit challenging to get started with, I found the procedural language to be quite similar to many software programs I've used or seen before, such as TouchDesigner and Unity.

ðŸ”´ I also completed general safety training and used the laser cutter in the Maker Space to cut a 1/4-inch wood board. I subtly modified the original design, adding more cutouts to reduce the overall weight of the cellphone stand.

## Speculations
> Technology is a word that describes something that doesnâ€™t work yet. â€” Douglas Adams

I love this quote because it accurately describes the current state of my MDes life and this project. I will develop a user scenario for the cellphone stand-up. Right now, two ideas come to mind: one would be a vertical holder for reading recipes while I'm cooking, and the other would emphasize horizontal placement. I also plan to incorporate 3D printing into the future fabrication process.


## Summary:
The first week has been fulfilling, my mind was 
reflect on the experience of exploring a procedural model whose output is a cell phone stand design in Rhino
Consider: What other contextual observations would be useful to capture?
Consider: What other evaluations of results would be useful to provide as feedback?

Consider: Are there points in the process where you think AIâ€¦
Could be used to assist?
Could be trained on input and output?
Other?
