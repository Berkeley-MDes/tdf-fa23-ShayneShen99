# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
Here's an example of creating a weekly progress report, in its own file. 
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

If you use this format, you might want to link back to the main [README.md](../README.md) like so!
