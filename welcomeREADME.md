# Hello DES INV 202 Student! üëã
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link! 

These instructions were originally contained in the **[README.md](README.md)** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###

# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

or, if you prefer, you can create separate files and link to them here, like so:

---
[Example Report 1](weekly-reports/example-report-1.md)

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- just keep this copy!
I hope you now feel empowered to make your GitHub Repository and README.md your own and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm ‚ú®
PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
